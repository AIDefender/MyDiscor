# DisCor in PyTorch
This is a PyTorch implementation of DisCor[[1]](#references). I tried to make it easy for readers to understand the algorithm. Please let me know if you have any questions.


## Installation
If you are using Anaconda, first create the virtual environment.

```bash
conda create -n discor python=3.8 -y
conda activate discor
```

You can install Python liblaries using pip.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
