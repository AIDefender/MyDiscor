# My Experiments on Discor
This repository is based on [discor-pytorch](https://github.com/ku2482/discor.pytorch) and [1]. I am going to add [on-policy reweight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13169)[2] and probably some other components.

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Samarth Sinha for kindly providing the source code of [2].
